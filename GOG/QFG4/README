Modified version of dosbox config file provided by GOG.

Usage:
dosbox -config ./dosboxQG4_FBSD.conf

Works well on FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE with DOSBox version 0.74.

How to:
GOG provides Quest for Glory 4 only for windows. Game is not supported by
ScumVM and it's based on SCI.
But internally uses dosbox to run.
So you will need install it under wine emulator and then use provided
dosbox config file.

I also reconfigured sound settings via INSTALL.EXE but I'm not sure if
this step is necessary for fully working sound.

Enjoy!
